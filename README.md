## üéØ Purpose

When conducting environmental-social consultancy work, gathering a location's demographic data is often important. PhilAtlas has been a convenient source of demographic data for Filipino consultants. However, without programming knowledge, consultants are forced to perform the monotonous task of manually gathering data for hundreds of locations. When budget and time allow, interns or encoders are usually tasked with this job. Software programs can make this task redundant, freeing up employees to be more engaged in their work.
